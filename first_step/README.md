## Project First Step: UDP File Transfer 

This project first step consists of a client and server that transfer files between each other using the UDP protocol. The client sends a file to the server, which then sends it back to the client.

### Structure

- `client.py`: UDP client script.
- `server.py`: UDP server script.
- `env_props.py`: File containing environment configurations.

### Usage Instructions

#### 1. Environment Configuration
   The `env_props.py` file contains the following configured variables:

   ```python
   CLIENT_HOST = ('localhost', 8080)  # Example client configuration
   SERVER_HOST = ('localhost', 6060)  # Example server configuration
   MAX_BUFF_SIZE = 1024  # Buffer size in bytes
   ```

#### 2. Run the Server
   In a terminal, navigate to the project first step folder directory and run the server script:

   ```python
   python3 server.py
   ```

   ```python
   python server.py
   ```
   ##### Use "python server.py" only if the computer contains different versions of python

   You will see the following message indicating the server is running:
   ```python
   üåê Server is running on localhost with PORT 6060!
   ```

#### 3. Run the Client
  Open another terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the client script:

   ```python
   python3 client.py
   ```

   ```python
   python client.py
   ```
   ##### Use "python client.py" only if the computer contains different versions of python

   The client will prompt for the name of the file to send to the server. Input the file name (e.g., `image.png` or `text.txt`) and press Enter:
   ```python
   üí¨ Enter the file name to send to server, you can choose 'image.png' or 'text.txt': image.png # Here goes your input
   ```

#### 4. File Transfer
   The client will send the specified file to the server and wait to receive the same file back. Informative messages will be displayed in both the client and server terminals indicating the progress of the transfer.

#### 5. Terminate the Connection
   After the transfer is complete, the client and server will display messages indicating the termination of operations and will close the sockets.
   ```python
   # In Client terminal 
   üõë Stopping client socket!

   # In Server terminal
   üõë Stopping server socket!
   ```

### Conclusion
   In the project first step folder directory, after carrying out the above process, there will be new `.png` or `.txt` files, *depending* on what you chose in *step 3*, renamed to confirm that the file transfer took place.
